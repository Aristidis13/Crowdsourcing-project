# Crowdsource Analyzer
This is an unfinished web development project.
It is my first truly lengthy project and it is about the creation of a crowdsource analyzer that gives the opportunity to the user to:
 - upload files with his google location history data.
 - see in charts the results of his uploads.
 - select and see in a heatmap his movements
 - make an estimation by the sensors of his smartphone how much he uses his body (ecological score) for his movements.

He can signup as a user by providing his email, password, and his username of choice. The system uses 2-way encryption techniques and hashing to ensure security for the database.
Also, the second type of user is the admin who:
 - can see all the results from the uploads of the users
 - can select and see in a heatmap the results of uploaded data for a specific period of time.
 - can export the data as a CSV, XML, or JSON file.

Both users must log in and be validated from the database to access their main page.
This project does not run because the styling and configuration file to access the database has been saved to another folder config for security reasons.
